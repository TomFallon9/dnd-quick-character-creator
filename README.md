## Purpose
Have you ever needed to make a Dungeons and Dragons character on the fly? Well look no further! More Text...

## Features 

![image of app](public/images/characterStats.png)
Once you have selected the proper fields to create your character an easy to read and understand stat page is generated. Hovering over a certain stat/trait will generate a small text box describing the individual stat or trait. This makes for easy understanding to even the most beginner player. 


![image of app](public/images/characters.png)
Want to create more than one character? Not a problem! An easy to view page allows the user to see all the characters they have created. A simple click will send you right to that characters stats page.
